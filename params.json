Outdated files are now deleted.\r\n  - Added a cleaning script that can be run by cron to keep the files'pool clean.\r\n  - The infinite validity option can be disabled.\r\n  - The validity period is now defaulted to one week (the default can be changed.)\r\n\r\nPlease also note that this version is not compatible with the 0.5 release, and the uploaded files would be lost using this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nJyraphe 0.5 (26 juin 2009)\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n  - Corrected installer\r\n  - Easier use of the installer (the enter key can be used to validate a step)\r\n  - The installer script (install.php) must be deleted for the jyraphe to work.
